## Best Practices

### List Naming Conventions

✅ **Good Names:**
- "Bros & Brews 2025 - Soft Commits"
- "Q1 Newsletter Subscribers"
- "Board Members - Active"
- "Event Prospects - High Priority"

❌ **Bad Names:**
- "List 1"
- "Test"
- "Contacts"
- "asdfasdf"

### List Descriptions

**Be Specific:**
- ✅ "Friends & family who clicked the invite link but haven't RSVPed"
- ❌ "Some people"

**Include Context:**
- When created
- Purpose
- Expected use case

### List Types Selection

**Use "General Contact" when:**
- Broadcasting to everyone
- Newsletter campaigns
- Org-wide announcements

**Use "Org Member" when:**
- Internal communications
- Member-only content
- Leadership updates

**Use "Event Attendee" when:**
- Event-specific targeting
- Pipeline stage campaigns
- Follow-up sequences
- Dynamic lists that update with pipeline

### Performance Optimization

**Large Lists (1000+ contacts):**
- Use pagination in ContactListDetail
- Export to CSV for bulk operations
- Consider breaking into smaller segments

**Dynamic Lists:**
- Refresh before use if data might be stale
- Monitor pipeline changes
- Use preview before creating

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No contacts found" after creating list

**Possible Causes:**
1. Filters too restrictive
2. No contacts match criteria
3. Event has no attendees yet

**Solution:**
- Check event has attendees
- Verify audience type filter
- Try broader pipeline stage selection
- Preview before creating

---

### Issue: List count doesn't match expected

**Possible Causes:**
1. Duplicate contacts filtered out
2. Pipeline stages changed
3. Contacts removed from event

**Solution:**
- Refresh the list (event attendee type only)
- Check Contact model for contactListId field
- Verify event pipeline current state

---

### Issue: Can't export CSV

**Possible Causes:**
1. Browser blocking download
2. Large list timing out
3. Missing contact data

**Solution:**
- Check browser download settings
- For lists >5000 contacts, use backend export
- Verify contacts have email field

---

### Issue: List not appearing in campaign selector

**Possible Causes:**
1. List marked as inactive
2. List belongs to different org
3. Zero contacts in list

**Solution:**
- Check list `isActive` field
- Verify orgId matches
- Ensure list has contacts

---

## Campaign Integration

### From Campaign Wizard

The Campaign Wizard (`/campaignwizard`) integrates seamlessly:

**Step 1: Campaign Name & Audience**
- Displays all active contact lists
- Shows contact count per list
- Allows direct navigation to create new list
- Visual selection with contact count

**Empty State:**
- Clear message: "No contact lists found"
- Direct link to `/contact-list-builder`
- Helpful guidance

### From Create Campaign

The Create Campaign page (`/createcampaign`) includes:
- Dropdown selector with contact counts
- Link to create new list
- Validation to prevent empty list selection

### From Campaign Home

Campaign Dashboard (`/campaignhome`) provides:
- Quick action card for Contact Lists
- Direct navigation to `/contact-list-manager`
- Prominent placement in Quick Actions

## Migration Notes

### Deprecated Pages

The following pages are deprecated and should redirect to new system:

- ❌ `ContactList.jsx` → ✅ `ContactListManager.jsx`
- ❌ `ListManagement.jsx` → ✅ `ContactListManager.jsx`
- ❌ `ContactListSelect.jsx` → ✅ `ContactListBuilder.jsx`
- ❌ `CreateListOptions.jsx` → ✅ `ContactListBuilder.jsx`

### Database Schema

**ContactList Model (Prisma):**
```prisma
model ContactList {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  orgId       String
  name        String
  description String?
  type        String
  
  // Event attendee specific
  eventId      String?
  audienceType String?
  stages       String[]
  
  // Stats
  totalContacts Int      @default(0)
  lastUpdated   DateTime @default(now())
  usageCount    Int      @default(0)
  lastUsed      DateTime?
  isActive      Boolean  @default(true)
  
  // Relations
  contacts  Contact[]
  campaigns Campaign[]
  
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
}
```

**Contact Model Update:**
```prisma
model Contact {
  id            String  @id @default(cuid())
  contactListId String? // Foreign key to ContactList
  contactList   ContactList? @relation(...)
  // ... other fields
}
```
