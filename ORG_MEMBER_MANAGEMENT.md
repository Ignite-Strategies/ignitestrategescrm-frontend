# Org Member Management

**Org Members are the lifeblood of an org...**

We must manage them as the sacred tribe.

---

## 🎯 The Sacred Truth

OrgMembers represent the **inner circle** - people who have been elevated from general contacts to core team members. They are:
- Board members
- Staff
- Volunteers
- Committee members
- Long-time supporters who deserve special status

---

## 📊 Two UXs to Manage Them from Dashboard

### 1. **Contact Management UX**
**Entry Point:** Dashboard → "Contact Management" Card

**Purpose:** View ALL contacts (universal), filter, and elevate specific ones to OrgMember status

**Flow:**
```
Dashboard
  ↓ Click "Contact Management"
ContactManageHome (/contacts)
  ↓ View all contacts
  ↓ Filter/search
  ↓ Click "Elevate to Org Member" on specific contact
  → Contact becomes OrgMember
```

**Current Pages:**
- ContactManageHome.jsx
- ContactUpload.jsx
- OrgMembersCSVUpload.jsx
- ContactManual.jsx

---

### 2. **Organization UX**
**Entry Point:** Dashboard → "Organization" or "Org Members" Card

**Purpose:** View ONLY OrgMembers (the sacred tribe), manage their org-specific data

**Flow:**
```
Dashboard
  ↓ Click "Organization" or "Org Members"
OrgMembers (/org-members)
  ↓ View ONLY people who are OrgMembers
  ↓ Edit org-specific fields (employer, years with org, engagement level)
  ↓ Manage the inner circle
```

**Current Page:**
- OrgMembers.jsx

---

## 🔍 Current State Analysis

### Path 1: Contact Management UX
**Entry:** Dashboard → "Contact Management" card → `/contacts`  
**Page:** `ContactManageHome.jsx`

**What it shows:**
- Total Contacts count
- Org Members count
- Prospects count (placeholder)
- Quick actions: Upload, See List, Create List
- Your Contact Lists (grid of saved lists)

**Issue:** "See List" button goes to `/org-members` 😕

---

### Path 2: Organization UX  
**Entry:** Dashboard → "Org Members" card → `/org-members`  
**Page:** `OrgMembers.jsx`

**What it shows:**
- Top 5 Engagers (high engagement members)
- Engagement stats (total, high, medium, low, inactive)
- Full table of ALL Org Members
- Editable fields: goesBy, email, phone, employer, categoryOfEngagement
- Actions: Add Member, Upload CSV, Contact Home

**Issues:**
- Shows engagement levels as "medium", "high", etc. 
- Confusing that BOTH paths converge at `/org-members`

---

## ❗ The Core Problem

**BOTH UX paths lead to the same `/org-members` page!**

```
Dashboard
  ├─ "Contact Management" → /contacts → "See List" button → /org-members
  └─ "Org Members" card → /org-members
```

This creates confusion:
- Users don't know which path to take
- "Contact Management" should show ALL contacts (not just org members)
- "Org Members" should show ONLY the sacred tribe
- But both go to the same place!

## 🎨 Proposed Refactor

### The Fix: Add "All Contacts" Button with Fork

**ContactManageHome needs 4 buttons (not 3):**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Quick Actions                                      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                     │
│  1. 🎯 All Contacts (PRIMARY - far left)           │
│     → Fork: Which contacts?                         │
│        • All Organization → /org-members            │
│        • Specific Event → EventContactManage        │
│                                                     │
│  2. 📤 Upload Contacts                              │
│     → Upload CSV                                    │
│                                                     │
│  3. 📋 See Lists                                    │
│     → /contact-lists (campaign lists)               │
│                                                     │
│  4. ✏️ Create List                                  │
│     → Create new campaign list                      │
│                                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### The Fork Flow

```
Click "All Contacts"
  ↓
ContactFork.jsx (/contacts/fork)
  ↓
  ┌─────────────────────────────────┐
  │ Which contacts do you want to   │
  │ manage?                         │
  │                                 │
  │  [All Organization]             │
  │  → /org-members                 │
  │  → Shows ALL org members        │
  │                                 │
  │  [Specific Event]               │
  │  → /contacts/event              │
  │  → Pick event                   │
  │  → Shows event contacts         │
  └─────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

### Event Contact Flow

```
Choose "Specific Event"
  ↓
EventContactManage.jsx (/contacts/event)
  ↓
Shows list of events
  ↓
Click event
  ↓
/event/:eventId/attendees
(Already exists! EventAttendeeList.jsx)
```

---

### What Changes

**ContactManageHome.jsx:**
- Change "See List" → "See Lists" 
- Add NEW button: "All Contacts" (far left, primary)
- "See Lists" stays but goes to `/contact-lists` (campaign lists)

**New Page Needed:**
- `ContactFork.jsx` - The choice page: Organization vs Event

**Organization Path:**
- Stays same: `/org-members` (OrgMembers.jsx)

**Event Path:**
- Can reuse existing EventAttendeeList.jsx
- Or create EventContactManage landing to pick event first

---

### Why This Works

✅ **Clear separation:**
- "All Contacts" → Fork → Choose scope (org or event)
- "See Lists" → Campaign lists (saved segments)
- "Create List" → Make new campaign list

✅ **No more defaulting to org:**
- User explicitly chooses Organization or Event

✅ **Event contacts are accessible:**
- Not hidden, clear path to get there

✅ **"List" means campaign list:**
- Not confused with "table of contacts"

*Completed: October 13, 2025*

## ✅ Implementation Complete!

### Files Created:
1. **ContactManageSelector.jsx** - The fork page with two options
2. **ORG_MEMBER_MANAGEMENT.md** - This documentation

### Files Modified:
1. **ContactManageHome.jsx** - Added "All Contacts" button, changed "See List" → "See Lists"
2. **App.jsx** - Added route for `/contacts/selector`

### New Flow:
```
ContactManageHome (/contacts)
  ↓ Click "All Contacts" (primary button, far left)
ContactManageSelector (/contacts/selector)
  ↓ Choose:
    • All Organization → /org-members (OrgMembers.jsx)
    • Specific Event → Select event → /event/:eventId/attendees (EventAttendeeList.jsx)
```

### What Works:
✅ Clear separation between org contacts and event contacts  
✅ Event dropdown hydrates on selector page (no extra click)  
✅ "See Lists" now means campaign lists, not contact tables  
✅ "All Contacts" is the primary action (indigo button, far left)  
✅ No more defaulting to org members  
✅ Beautiful UX with cards and icons  

**Test it:** Go to Dashboard → Contact Management → Click "All Contacts" 🚀
