- Each list shows: name, description, contact count
- **Conflict detection** with status indicators:

  - 🔄 **Active Campaign** (currently running)
  - ✅ **Available** (safe to use)

### **Smart Buttons:**
- **🔵 Use** - For available lists (creates/selects campaign)
- **🔴 Resolve Conflicts** - For conflicted lists
- **🟢 Duplicate** - Copy the list  
- **🔴 Delete** - Remove the list
- **🟠 Unassign** - Remove from draft campaigns

## 🎯 **Conflict Detection System**

### **Built Lists Section** (No Conflicts)
- Lists that are safe to use
- Green "✅ Available" badge
- Purple "Use" button

### **In Campaigns Section** (With Conflicts)
- Lists currently assigned to campaigns
- Color-coded warnings:
  - **Red** for sent campaigns (most dangerous)
  - **Orange** for draft campaigns
- Smart buttons based on conflict level

## 🚀 **"Use" Button Flow**

When you click "Use" on an available list:

1. **Loads available draft campaigns**
2. **If no campaigns exist:** Creates new campaign
3. **If campaigns exist:** Shows campaign selector
4. **Attaches list to selected campaign**
5. **Navigates to CampaignCreator** with campaign hydrated
