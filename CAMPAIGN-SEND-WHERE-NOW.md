# Campaign Send - Where Are We Now?

## ðŸŽ¯ Current State:
**Campaign flow is WORKING!** âœ…

## ðŸ“‹ The Flow:
1. **ContactListBuilder** (`/contact-list-builder`) - Create lists from org members/events
2. **ContactListCampaignSelector** (`/contact-list-manager`) - Pick list â†’ Pick campaign â†’ Attach
3. **CampaignCreator** (`/campaign-creator`) - Name â†’ List â†’ Message â†’ Preview
4. **CampaignPreview** (`/campaign-preview`) - Final review before send

## ðŸš€ What's Working:
- âœ… All steps visible in CampaignCreator (no more gatekeeping)
- âœ… Preview button always shows (disabled until name/subject/message filled)
- âœ… Smart field choosers (firstName, lastName, goesBy, email)
- âœ… List attachment to campaigns
- âœ… Gmail authentication
- âœ… Clean routing

## ðŸŽ¨ Architecture:
- **ContactListBuilder** = CREATOR (smart list cards)
- **ContactListCampaignSelector** = HUB (lists + campaign picker)
- **CampaignCreator** = CAMPAIGN BUILDER (all steps visible)

## ðŸ”¥ Ready to Send:
The campaign flow is complete and ready for sending emails!
