# Contact Management System

## 🎯 The Vision

**Simple Truth:** Contacts power everything - campaigns, events, outreach. This hub connects it all.

---

## 🗺️ The Contact Ecosystem

### Two Types of Contacts

#### 1. **Quick Contacts** (External)
- **Purpose:** Prospects, event attendees, campaign targets
- **Fields:** First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone (that's it!)
- **Upload:** `/contacts/upload` → ContactUpload.jsx
- **Template:** `contacts_simple_template.csv`
- **Magic:** Map to pipeline on ingest

#### 2. **Org Members** (Internal)
- **Purpose:** Core team, staff, board, volunteers
- **Fields:** All the deep dive (employer, years with org, etc.)
- **Upload:** `/org-members/upload` → OrgMembersCSVUpload.jsx
- **Template:** `contacts_template.csv`
- **Reality:** Most data comes from user input, not admin upload

## 🔧 Key Features

### 1. **Purpose-First Upload**
Choose BEFORE uploading:
- Event attendees
- Email campaign
- General contacts

### 2. **Pipeline Mapping on Ingest**
HubSpot killer: Map contacts to pipeline DURING upload, not after endless form filling.

### 3. **Post-Upload Fork**
After upload, clear next steps:
- View all contacts
- Add to event
- Start campaign
- Upload more

### 4. **Two Templates**
- Simple: Name, Email, Phone (quick)
- Full: All fields (org members)

---

## ⚠️ Current Issues & Refactor Needed

### Deprecated Files
- `OrgMembers.jsx` - Uses old MongoDB Supporter model
- Need new `ContactsView.jsx` using Prisma Contact model

### Duplicate Pages?
- `ContactList.jsx` - Campaign contact lists
- `ListManagement.jsx` - Check if this is a duplicate

### Naming Confusion
- "Org Members" vs "Contacts" vs "Supporters"
- Need consistent language throughout

---

## ✅ The Future State

```

### Integration Points
- **Events:** Click contact → add to event pipeline
- **Campaigns:** Click contact → add to campaign list
- **Org Members:** Flag as org member → additional fields

## 🚀 The Stickiness Strategy

### Phase 1: Admin Upload (Now)
- Admins upload contacts
- Admin guesses data ("Where does Bob work?")
- Not very sticky

### Phase 2: Member Input (Future)
- Members log in themselves
- Members input their own data:
  - Track workouts
  - Log service hours
  - Update their own profile
- **THIS is sticky** ✅

### Phase 3: Auto-Enrichment
- Members update themselves
- System enriches from activity
- True living database

## 🎯 Why This Beats HubSpot

| Feature | HubSpot | Us |
|---------|---------|-----|
| **Contact Model** | Deal-first (need deal → assign contact) | Contact-first ✅ |
| **Upload** | Fill ALL fields upfront | Simple upload → organize smart ✅ |
| **Pipeline** | Create deal → move stages | Map on ingest ✅ |
| **Purpose** | Generic for everyone | Purpose-driven flows ✅ |
| **Data Entry** | Admin guesses everything | Future: Members input their own ✅ |
